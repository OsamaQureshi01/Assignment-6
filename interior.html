      <td><h1>Interior</h1><br>The interior of the GT86 is designed to provide a focused and engaging driving experience,<br> with a layout that emphasizes simplicity and driver control. The cabin features <br> a low-slung seating position, giving the driver a connected feel with the car and the road. The dashboard is straightforward, with minimal distractions, putting essential controls <br>within easy reach.
        The materials used in the GT86's interior are a mix of soft-touch plastics, Alcantara, and leather accents,<br> depending on the trim level. This combination adds a sporty yet comfortable feel to the cabin. <br>The seats are typically well-bolstered, providing support during spirited driving, and some versions <br>feature leather or suede upholstery.<br>
        The steering wheel is small and wrapped in leather, designed for precision handling, <br>while the instrumentation includes analog dials for the tachometer and speedometer, ensuring clear <br>readability. A digital display complements the analog gauges, offering additional information like fuel <br>economy, trip details, and performance stats.
        There is also a touch-screen infotainment system in most models, offering Bluetooth connectivity,<br> navigation, and smartphone integration. However, the focus remains on driving rather than <br>high-tech gadgets, keeping the interior relatively simple compared to other modern sports cars.<br> The climate control system is typically manual, contributing to the car's lightweight and driver-centric<br> nature. Though the rear seats are small, they can be folded down to increase trunk space,<br> making the GT86 more practical for carrying larger items. Overall, the interior is more about <br>functionality and enhancing the driving experience rather than offering luxury or excessive technology.</td>
