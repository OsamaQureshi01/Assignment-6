        <p>The Toyota GT86’s interior emphasizes simplicity and functionality, creating a space that's focused on driving. The low seating position gives the driver<br>a strong sense of connection to the car, while the compact steering wheel adds to the feeling of control. The layout is intuitive, with controls easily accessible,  <br>allowing the driver to focus on the road without distractions.
          The sport seats are firm and offer excellent lateral support, holding the driver and passenger <br> in place during tight corners. Their design is practical rather than luxurious, reflecting the car’s performance-oriented character. For longer drives, <br> the seats provide a comfortable balance between support and comfort, ensuring that you stay well-positioned without excessive cushioning that might reduce <br> feedback from the car.
          The interior materials, while not high-end, are chosen for durability and functionality. The dashboard is clean and uncluttered, avoiding <br> unnecessary frills. Soft-touch plastics and simple, no-nonsense finishes dominate, giving the cabin a purposeful feel. The minimalistic design extends to the <br> infotainment system, which is straightforward and easy to use. It offers just enough features for modern convenience without overwhelming the driver with <br>excessive technology.
          In essence, the interior of the GT86 is a reflection of its overall philosophy: a focus on driving pleasure over luxury or high-tech <br>distractions. Every element is designed to enhance the connection between the driver and the car, making the interior a practical and engaging space for driving <br>enthusiasts.</p></td>
