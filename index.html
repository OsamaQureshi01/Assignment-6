    <p>The GT86 is all about driving pleasure. Its precise steering, balanced chassis, and responsive throttle make it ideal for those who love to be in control of the car’s dynamics. The car doesn’t rely on turbochargers or excessive horsepower; instead, it delivers fun in a more accessible and rewarding way. Some critics point out that the engine could use more power, but many fans appreciate its focus on handling and driver involvement over straight-line speed.The sport seats are firm and offer excellent lateral support, holding the driver and passenger in place during tight corners.

      <br><h1>1. Engine and Performance</h1><br>The GT86 is powered by a 2.0-liter flat-four (boxer) engine developed by Subaru, which produces <br>around 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque.

  <h1>2. Rear-Wheel Drive and Handling</h1>
    <p>One of the GT86's standout features is its rear-wheel-drive layout, a rarity in modern, affordable sports cars. This gives it a more traditional sports car feel, making it a popular choice for those who enjoy spirited driving or even drifting. The suspension is tuned for sharp handling, with excellent feedback and agility. The car’s weight distribution is close to 50:50, contributing to its balanced handling and making it particularly fun to drive on twisty roads or the track.
    </p>
  <h1>3. Lightweight Design</h1>
  <p>Weighing around 2,800 pounds, the GT86 is relatively light, which further enhances its performance and handling. The lightweight design, coupled with a low center of gravity, means the car feels nimble and responsive, offering great cornering ability. The minimalistic approach to weight also reinforces the car’s identity as a purist’s sports car.
